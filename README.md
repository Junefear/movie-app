2. [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) library was added for UI components.
3. [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) was added for efficient state management.
4. Mock data was added for development and testing purposes.
5. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) was added for utility-first CSS styling.
6. [JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) was added to provide a full fake REST API for the mock data. You can install it with `npm i json-server` and run it with `json-server --watch db.json --port 3004`.
